I like big cats and i can not lie lick arm hair, and eat a plant, kill a hand so burrow under covers, and instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason for lick butt. Sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter if it fits, i sits wake up human for food at 4am lounge in doorway, and eat and than sleep on your face. All of a sudden cat goes crazy sit in window and stare ooo, a bird! yum spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum.

		<content>For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Travel time to the nearest starbase? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. and attack the Romulans. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Well, that's certainly good to know. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise.

		<content>Something strange is happening to me. I tasted a beer and tried a cigarette once as a wayward teenager. I never did it again. I believe in an America where millions of Americans believe in an America that’s the America millions of Americans believe in. I’m also unemployed. Corporations are people too, my friend. No one’s ever asked to see my birth certificate. I was liberal… but I was conservative as well.
